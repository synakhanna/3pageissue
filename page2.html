		<p>To prevent waste from harming our atmosphere, people should be educated on the concept of recycling. Recycling materials such as plastic, paper, and glass will ensure that the materials will be reused rather than wasted and turned into toxins.</p>

		<p>The concept of composting is also not well-known. Materials such as leaves, fruits, and vegetables are all compostable. Composting recycles the materials to ensure that they act as nutrient-rich fertilizers for soil.</p>

		<p>If more people contribute to the acts of recycling and composting, less materials will be wasted and large dumps will be prevented.</p>
